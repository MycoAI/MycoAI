# Paper scripts
The scripts in this folder were used to produce the experiments and results as 
presented in the paper. They may contain variables (e.g. filepaths) specific to 
our setup. For training your own model or evaluting your results, we refer to 
the [scripts](/mycoai/scripts/) folder. Nevertheless, feel free to customize the
code in this subfolder to your own wishes.
